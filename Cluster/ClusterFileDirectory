Cluster:

FileDirectory:

This folder contains all of the scripts, parameters, seeds, and data **that was actually put on the cluster and run to make the paper**. With the exception of the ABC analysis, which is run locally. 

Running these functions should recreate the data used in the manuscript exactly! Parsing and analysis of the outputs can be done using the R scripts provided in the other folders in /EpistasisSim.

I've divided each of the analyses into 4 large "types"

I will only provide a detailed file directory for the /MutDriftBalance/snps/ file, but all of the scripts should be very similar

## EmpT0
	Scripts contained in this file all have the loci begin from their empirical starting frequencies and the number of loci is held constant in all of the simulations.

## MutDriftBalance
	Scripts contained in this file have the loci begin from a sample of empirical **non**selected allele frequencies.

## nloci
	Scripts contained in this file all have the number of loci underrlying a trait vary.

## T0.5
	Scripts in this file all have the loci begin with a starting frequency of 0.5
