The purpose of this folder is to walk the reader through the workflow of one of the analyses done.
We focus on the analysis of a variable number of snps located on up to 121 larger unlinked haplotype blocks. The functions contained here are copied and pasted from elsewhere in the github but these are well commented, and this walkthrough exists to tell the reader the order of the steps that they need to take. Every analysis takes steps similar to this one, but are all a bit different (e.g. analyses where the number of loci is not varied will not have a selectedloci.csv data frame). This is one of the more complicated analyses, so the others should be a simplification of what is commented on here.

## Step 1 ##
############
Done locally:

Files needed:
haplotype_blocks.snp_res.RDS: empirical data concerning the candidate snps
hap_block_snps.neutral_AFC_cutoffs.RDS: AFC cutoffs for the candidate snps
parammaker.R: Creates two dataframes, one which contains a list of parameter values for each simulation run in each of its rows and one that contains which snps are included in each of the simulations where there are a reduced number of loci contributing to fitness
makerecommap.R: Takes in the two RDS objects and creates a csv of the data needed in slim. Also takes the position of the snps included in each simulation and creates a recombination map to be used in slim.

Steps to take:
First open parammaker.R and run up until the deprecated section (line 68). This should create two files. One, params.txt, is a matrix of parameter values used in each simulation ocuppying the rows. sampledloci.csv is a list of all of the loci included in each simulation occupying rows.  

After those two files are created, we are going to open makerecommap.R. This will take in two RDS dataframes and turn them into a csv that is useful in SLiM. Also, this function will take in the sampledloci.csv that we just created and calculate the recombination fraction between all snps included in each simulation (i.e. the recombination map) based on the snps physical position and the T californicus recombaination rate. Running makerecommap.R should create two more data files, sortedsnpdata.csv and RecomMap.csv

Files Created:
params.txt: its rows contain a list of parameter values used in each slim simulation
sampledloci.csv: its rows contain a list of the loci included in each simulation
sortedsnpdata.csv: empirical parameters of the model (e.g. starting frequencies, selection coefficients etc)
RecomMap.csv: its rows contain recombination fractions between adjacent snps included in the model.
