MutDrift hb:

File Directory:

This folder contains helper functions and data for the analysis of 121 unlinked haplotype blocks from starting frequencies sampled from nonselected snps, where we vary the type of fitness function used.

## clusteroutputparser.R
	Takes a large unsorted list of raw SLiM outputs from the cluster and organizes the files based on parameter values used in the SLiM simulations.

## hap_blocks.jaccard.neutral999.RDS
	Empirical jaccard scores

## mutdriftinfo.csv
	Contains starting freqs of 100,000 nonselected snps to sample from when initializing each simulation

## New.slim
	SLiM simulation **designed to be run locally for testing**

## parammaker.R
	Creates a matrix of parameter values and random seeds to be looped through when running the simulations on the cluster

## params.txt
	Output of parammaker.R. 

## parsedouttojaccard.R
	Script to go through the organized SLiM outputs from clusteroutputparser.R and calculate the pairwise jaccard score between replicate populations for each simulation.

## sim.results.csv
	Output of parsedouttojaccard.R

## sortedhbdata.csv
	Haplotype block parameters in a format usable in SLiM
