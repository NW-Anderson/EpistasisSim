Within the simulations where loci begin at their starting frequencies, there are several types of analysis.

## alpha
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the alpha parameter of the directional epistasis model

## hb
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the fitness function used and is performed on 121 unlinked haplotype blocks

## hbLinkage
	The simulations performed withing this folder vary the fitness function used and are performed on 121 haplotype blocks which are linked together on 4 larger chromosomes.

## snps
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the fitness function used and are performed on 4977 snps linked together on 121 larger unlinked haplptype blocks
