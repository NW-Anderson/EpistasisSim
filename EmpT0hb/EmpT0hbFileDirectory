This folder contains helper functions and data for the analysis of 121 unlinked haplotype blocks from empirical starting frequencies where we vary the type of fitness function used.

## clusteroutputparser.R
	Takes a large unsorted list of raw SLiM outputs from the cluster and organizes the files based on parameter values used in the SLiM simulations.

## hap_blocks.jaccard.neutral999.RDS
	Empirical jaccard scores

## hap_blocks.neutral_AFC_cutoffs.RDS
	AFC cuttoffs of the haplotype blocks which are used in the model

## hap_blocks.res.RDS
	Parameters which are used in the model

## makerecommap.R
	Takes in the RDS data and outputs it in a form that is usable in SLiM

## New.slim
	SLiM simulation **designed to be run locally for testing**

## parammaker.R
	Creates a matrix of parameter values and random seeds to be looped through when running the simulations on the cluster

## parsedouttojaccard.R
	Script to go through the organized SLiM outputs from clusteroutputparser.R and calculate the pairwise jaccard score between replicate populations for each simulation.

## sim.results.csv
	Output of parsedouttojaccard.R

## sortedhbdata.csv
	Haplotype block parameters in a format usable in SLiM 

## testparams.txt
	parameter matrix created for testing on the cluster
