This folder contains helper functions and data for the analysis of 121 unlinked haplotype blocks from empirical starting  frequenciess, where we vary the both the number of loci contributing to fitness as type of fitness funciton.

## clusteroutputparser.R
	Takes a large unsorted list of raw SLiM outputs from the cluster and organizes the files based on parameter values used in the SLiM simulations.

## hap_blocks.jaccard.neutral999.RDS
	Empirical jaccard scores

## hap_blocks.neutral_AFC_cutoffs.RDS
	AFC cuttoffs of the snps which are used in the model

## hap_blocks.res.RDS
	Parameters which are used in the model

## makerecommap.R
	Takes in the RDS data and outputs it in a form that is usable in SLiM. This version also takes position of each snp and calculates the recombination fraction between adjacent snps from a given per base pair recombination rate. 

## New.slim
	SLiM simulation **designed to be run locally for testing**

## parammaker.R
	Creates a matrix of parameter values and random seeds to be looped through when running the simulations on the cluster. This version also creates a matrix of randomly sampled loci, which are included in the simulations with the reduced number of loci.

## params.txt
	Output of parammaker.R. 

## parsedouttojaccard.R
	Script to go through the organized SLiM outputs from clusteroutputparser.R and calculate the pairwise jaccard score between replicate populations for each simulation.

## sampledloci.csv
	Output of parammaker.R, the loci included in each of the simulations.

## sim.results.csv
	Output of parsedouttojaccard.R

## sortedhbdata.csv
	Haplotype block parameters in a format usable in SLiM
