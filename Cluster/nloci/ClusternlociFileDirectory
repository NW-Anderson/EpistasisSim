FileDirectory:

Simulations within this directory vary the number of loci contributing to fitness

## alpha
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the alpha parameter of the directional epistasis model

## hb
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the fitness function used and is performed on variable number of unlinked haplotype blocks

## snps
	The simulations performed within this folder vary the fitness function used and are performed on a variable number of snps linked together on up to 121 larger unlinked haplptype blocks
